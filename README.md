# SimpleVoxel
SimpleVoxel is using pseudo instancing technique to work on old mobile or old divices which is not suported instancing. There is this sort of class at asset store or git but I wanted create simple one and easy to modify code to any projects. If you know very fundamental matrix, vector and geometry pipeline, you can easily modify.
